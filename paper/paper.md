## Summary
Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a promising non-invasive, radiation-free technology for
monitoring the respiratory system of patients who undergo mechanical ventilation in the Intensive
Care Unit. While EIT is gaining popularity, the complexity of data processing, analysis and
interpretation hamper standardization, validation and widespread adoption. Commercial software is
closed and opaque, while custom research software is often ad-hoc, single use and unverified.
`eitprocessing` offers a standardized, open, and highly expandable pipeline for the processing and
analysis of EIT and related data.

## State of the field
<!-- Or skip, because it will be very short, better suited as part of statement of need? -->

## Statement of need
<!-- Peter (or delegate), part from TDCC? -->

## Key features 
<!-- Dani -->
<!-- TODO:  example with animal-data -->
<!-- TODO:  update example in notebook updaten with newer features -->
<!-- TODO:  example notebook Dani/Peter -->

### Data containers

## Future perspective

- include more algorithms as they are necessary and introduced in literature, e.g. @Wisse2024-wi
- seek international collaboration
