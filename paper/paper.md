## Summary
Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a promising non-invasive, radiation-free technology for
monitoring the respiratory system of patients who undergo mechanical ventilation in the Intensive
Care Unit. While EIT is gaining popularity, the complexity of data processing, analysis and
interpretation hamper standardization, validation and widespread adoption. Commercial software is
closed and opaque, while custom research software is often ad-hoc, single use and unverified.
`eitprocessing` offers a standardized, open, and highly expandable pipeline for the processing and
analysis of EIT and related data.


## Statement of need
Acute respiratory failure is the most common reason for admission to the intensive care unit (ICU),
and can be caused by e.g., infection, trauma, heart failure, or complications during elective
surgery. Patients with severely injured lungs and critically low levels of arterial oxygen require
life-saving breathing support with mechanical ventilation [@tobin1998]. Although mechanical
ventilation is the cornerstone of supportive therapy in the ICU, it is a double-edge sword:
inadequate mechanical ventilator assist exacerbates lung injury and inflammation, and worsens
outcomes [@Slutsky2013;@Amato2015]. ICU mortality for patients with acute respiratory failure remains
high  [~40%, @Bellani2016]; these numbers increased drastically during the COVID-19 pandemic. To
ameliorate the risk of death and long-term morbidity of the critically ill, we need mechanical
ventilation strategies that are lung-protective and tailored to the individual patientâ€™s
respiratory physiology [@Goligher2020;@Goligher2020b]. However, there are yet no simple and reliable
and readily accessible techniques available to clinicians at the bedside to identify the beneficial
and harmful effects of adaptations in mechanical ventilator support [@Jonkman2022].

A very promising technology to change clinical practice in ICU patients is Electrical Impedance
Tomography (EIT) [@Frerichs2016]. EIT is gaining popularity worldwide as a bedside non-invasive radiation-free
lung imaging tool: using a belt mounted with electrodes placed around the chest, it continuously
and real- time visualizes changes in lung volume owing to adaptations in ventilator pressures or
because of changes in lung characteristics, resulting from worsening or improving lung function. In
contrast to static anatomical imaging techniques such as computed tomography scan, EIT provides
dynamic information on lung ventilation. As such, EIT can monitor at the bedside the direct impact
of mechanical ventilation on the lung and provides important information to assist in the clinical
decision-making. Personalizing mechanical ventilation using EIT monitoring and diagnostics may
ameliorate the risk of death and long-term morbidity, and may substantially reduce the burden on
our healthcare system.

The perspective that EIT will become an important standard monitoring technique is shared by
international experts [@Frerichs2016]. In that same work, @Frerichs2016 emphasize the importance of
standardized techniques, terminology and consensus regarding applications was extensively
discussed. However, validated methods to implement EIT information in routine care are still
lacking and synchronizing EIT data with other bedside respiratory monitoring modalities is often
practically impossible. Standardized implementation of EIT information is further limited because
the availability of bedside analysis tools depends on the type of EIT device used. Advanced image
and signal analysis could overcome certain challenges but also requires complex post-processing
(including detection/removal of common artefacts) and specific technical expertise that is often
not present in clinical practice. This currently hampers reproducibility of research findings and
clinical implementation. Moreover, it stresses the importance of close collaboration between
physicians, clinical researchers and engineers in order to identify clinical needs, to develop and
validate new algorithms, and to facilitate clinical implementation.

`eitprocessing` offers a standardized, open, and highly expandable library of tools for loading,
filtering, segmentation and analysis of EIT data. `eitprocessing` can work with data from the three
main clinically available EIT devices, as well as from related data sources. It includes commonly
used methods for filtering and segmentation. Further algorithms for analysis are continuously
developed for current and future projects by the authors. The international community has been
invited to use and contribute to the software.
