              various respiratory conditions and lung perfusion. Its

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Popularity of electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
              and esophageal pressure (Pes) monitoring in the ICU is
              increasing, but there is uncertainty regarding their bedside use
              within a personalized ventilation strategy. We aimed to gather
              insights about the current experiences and perceived role of
              these physiological monitoring techniques, and to identify
              barriers and facilitators/solutions for EIT and Pes
              implementation. METHODS: Qualitative study involving (1) a survey
              targeted at ICU clinicians with interest in advanced respiratory
              monitoring and (2) an expert focus group discussion. The survey
              was shared via international networks and personal communication.
              An in-person discussion session on barriers,
              facilitators/solutions for EIT implementation was organized with
              an international panel of EIT experts as part of a multi-day EIT
              meeting. Pes was not discussed in-person, but we found the focus
              group results relevant to Pes as well. This was confirmed by the
              survey results and four additional Pes experts that were
              consulted. RESULTS: We received 138 survey responses, and 26
              experts participated in the in-person discussion. Survey
              participants had diverse background [physicians (54\%),
              respiratory therapists (19\%), clinical researchers (15\%), and
              nurses (6\%)] with mostly > 10 year ICU experience. 84\% of Pes
              users and 74\% of EIT users rated themselves as competent to
              expert users. Techniques are currently primarily used during
              controlled ventilation for individualization of PEEP (EIT and
              Pes), and for monitoring lung mechanics and lung stress (Pes).
              EIT and Pes are considered relevant techniques to guide
              ventilation management and is helpful for educating clinicians;
              however, 57\% of EIT users and 37\% of Pes users agreed that
              further validation is needed. Lack of equipment/materials,
              evidence-based guidelines, clinical protocols, and/or the
              time-consuming nature of the measurements are main reasons
              hampering Pes and EIT application. Identified
              facilitators/solutions to improve implementation include
              international guidelines and collaborations between
              clinicians/researcher and manufacturers, structured courses for
              training and use, easy and user-friendly devices and standardized
              analysis pipelines. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed insights on
              the role and implementation of advanced respiratory monitoring
              with EIT and Pes. The identified barriers, facilitators and
              strategies can serve as input for further discussions to promote
              the development of EIT-guided or Pes-guided personalized
              ventilation strategies.},
