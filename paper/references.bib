  abstract  = {Objective.Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) produces
               clinical useful visualization of the distribution of ventilation
               inside the lungs. The accuracy of EIT-derived parameters can be
               compromised by the cardiovascular signal. Removal of these
               artefacts is challenging due to spectral overlapping of the
               ventilatory and cardiovascular signal components and their
               time-varying frequencies. We designed and evaluated advanced
               filtering techniques and hypothesized that these would
               outperform traditional low-pass filters.Approach.Three filter
               techniques were developed and compared against traditional
               low-pass filtering: multiple digital notch filtering (MDN),
               empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and the maximal overlap
               discrete wavelet transform (MODWT). The performance of the
               filtering techniques was evaluated (1) in the time domain (2) in
               the frequency domain (3) by visual inspection. We evaluated the
               performance using simulated contaminated EIT data and data from
               15 adult and neonatal intensive care unit patients.Main
               result.Each filter technique exhibited varying degrees of
               effectiveness and limitations. Quality measures in the time
               domain showed the best performance for MDN filtering. The signal
               to noise ratio was best for DLP, but at the cost of a high
               relative and removal error. MDN outbalanced the performance
               resulting in a good SNR with a low relative and removal error.
               MDN, EMD and MODWT performed similar in the frequency domain and
               were successful in removing the high frequency components of the
               data.Significance.Advanced filtering techniques have benefits
               compared to traditional filters but are not always better. MDN
               filtering outperformed EMD and MODWT regarding quality measures
               in the time domain. This study emphasizes the need for careful
               consideration when choosing a filtering approach, depending on
               the dataset and the clinical/research question.},
