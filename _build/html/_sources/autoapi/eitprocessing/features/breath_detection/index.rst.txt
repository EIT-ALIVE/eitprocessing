.. py:class:: BreathDetection

   Algorithm for detecting breaths in data representing respiration.

   This algorithm detects the position of breaths in data by detecting valleys
   (local minimum values) and peaks (local maximum values) in data. When
   initializing BreathDetection, the sample frequency of the data and the
   minimum duration of a breath have to be provided. The minimum duration
   should be short enough to include the shortest expected breath in the data.

   Examples:
   >>> bd = BreathDetection(sample_frequency=50, minimum_duration=0.5)
   >>> breaths = bd.find_breaths(global_impedance)

   .. py:method:: _find_features(data: numpy.ndarray, moving_average: numpy.ndarray, invert: float = False) -> tuple[numpy.ndarray, numpy.ndarray]

      Find features (peaks or valleys) in the data.

      This method finds features (either peaks or valleys) in the data using
      the `scipy.signal.find_peaks()` function. The minimum distance (in
      time) between peaks is determined by the `minimum_distance` attribute.

      To find peaks, `invert` should be False. To find valleys, `invert`
      should be True, which flips the data before finding peaks.

      :param data: a 1D array containing the data.
      :type data: np.ndarray
      :param moving_average: a 1D array containing the moving average
                             of the data.
      :type moving_average: NDArrag
      :param invert: whether to invert the data before
      :type invert: float, optional
      :param detecting peaks. Defaults to False.:

      :returns: A tuple containing two 1D arrays of length N with the indices (int)
                and values (float) of the features, where N is the number of
                features found.


   .. py:method:: _remove_edge_cases(peak_indices: numpy.ndarray, peak_values: numpy.ndarray, valley_indices: numpy.ndarray, valley_values: numpy.ndarray, data: numpy.ndarray, moving_average: numpy.ndarray) -> _PeakValleyData

      Remove overdetected peaks/valleys at the start and end of the data.

      This method removes a valley at the start of the data if the data before said valley stays below the moving
      average of the data at said valley. Likewise, it removes the last valley if the data after the last valley stays
      below the moving average of the data at said valley. This ensures a valley is a true valley, and not just a
      local minimum while the true valley is cut off.

      Then, all peaks that occur before the first and after the last valley
      are removed. This ensures peaks only fall between valleys.

      :param peak_indices: indices of the peaks
      :type peak_indices: np.ndarray
      :param peak_values: values of the peaks
      :type peak_values: np.ndarray
      :param valley_indices: indices of the valleys
      :type valley_indices: np.ndarray
      :param valley_values: values of the valleys
      :type valley_values: np.ndarray
      :param data: the data in which the peaks/valleys were detected
      :type data: np.ndarray
      :param moving_average: the moving average of data
      :type moving_average: np.ndarray

      :returns: A tuple (peak_indices, peak_values, valley_indices, valley_values)
                with edge cases removed.


   .. py:method:: _remove_doubles(peak_indices: numpy.ndarray, peak_values: numpy.ndarray, valley_indices: numpy.ndarray, valley_values: numpy.ndarray) -> _PeakValleyData

      Remove double peaks/valleys.

      This method ensures there is only one peak between valleys, and only
      one valley between peaks. If there are multiple peaks between two
      valleys, the peak with the highest value is kept and the others are
      removed. If there are no peaks between several valleys (i.e. multiple
      valleys between peaks) the valley with the lowest value is kept, while
      the others are removed.

      This method does not remove peaks before the first or after the last
      valley.

      :param peak_indices: indices of the peaks
      :type peak_indices: np.ndarray
      :param peak_values: values of the peaks
      :type peak_values: np.ndarray
      :param valley_indices: indices of the valleys
      :type valley_indices: np.ndarray
      :param valley_values: values of the valleys
      :type valley_values: np.ndarray

      :returns: A tuple (peak_indices, peak_values, valley_indices, valley_values)
                with double peaks/valleys removed.


   .. py:method:: _remove_low_amplitudes(peak_indices: numpy.ndarray, peak_values: numpy.ndarray, valley_indices: numpy.ndarray, valley_values: numpy.ndarray) -> _PeakValleyData

      Remove peaks if the amplitude is low compared to the median amplitude.

      The amplitude of a peak is determined as the average vertical distance
      between the peak value and the two valley values besides it. The cutoff
      value for the amplitude is calculated as the median amplitude times
      `amplitude_cutoff_fraction`. Peaks that have an amplitude below the
      cutoff are removed. Then, `_remove_doubles()` is called to remove
      either of the valleys next to the peak.

      If `amplitude_cutoff_fraction` is None, the input is returned
      unchanged.

      :param peak_indices: the indices of the peaks
      :type peak_indices: np.ndarray
      :param peak_values: the values of the peaks
      :type peak_values: np.ndarray
      :param valley_indices: the indices of the valleys
      :type valley_indices: np.ndarray
      :param valley_values: the values of the valleys
      :type valley_values: np.ndarray

      :returns: A tuple (peak_indices, peak_values, valley_indices, valley_values)
                with low-amplitude breaths removed.


   .. py:method:: _remove_breaths_around_invalid_data(breaths: list[eitprocessing.datahandling.breath.Breath], data: numpy.ndarray, time: numpy.ndarray) -> list[eitprocessing.datahandling.breath.Breath]

      Remove breaths overlapping with invalid data.

      This function defines a lower and upper cutoff. Data beyond those cutoffs is considered invalid for the
      purposes of breath detection. Breaths that start within a window length of invalid data are removed.

      The lower cutoff is a distance away from the mean. The distance is m times the distance between the
      mean and the nth percentile of the data. m is given by `invalid_data_removal_multiplier` and n is given by
      `invalid_data_removal_percentile`.

      For example, with m = 4 and n = 5, the mean = 100, and 5% of the data is below/equal to 90, all data below 100 -
      (4 * 10) = 60 and above 100 + (4 * 10) = 140 is considerd invalid.

      :param breaths: list of detected breath objects
      :param data: data the breaths were detected in
      :param time: time axis belonging to the data


   .. py:method:: find_breaths(sequence: eitprocessing.datahandling.sequence.Sequence, continuousdata_label: str) -> eitprocessing.datahandling.intervaldata.IntervalData

      Find breaths in the data.

      This method attempts to find peaks and valleys in the data in a
      multi-step process. First, it naively finds any peaks that are a
      certain distance apart and higher than the moving average, and
      similarly valleys that are a certain distance apart and below the
      moving average.

      Next, valleys at the start and end of the signal are removed
      to ensure the first and last valleys are actual valleys, and not just
      the start or end of the signal. Peaks before the first or after the
      last valley are removed, to ensure peaks always fall between two
      valleys.

      At this point, it is possible multiple peaks exist between two valleys.
      Lower peaks are removed leaving only the highest peak between two
      valleys. Similarly, multiple valleys between two peaks are reduced to
      only the lowest valley.

      As a last step, breaths with a low amplitude (the average between the
      inspiratory and expiratory amplitudes) are removed.

      Breaths are constructed as a valley-peak-valley combination,
      representing the start of inspiration, the end of inspiration/start of
      expiration, and end of expiration.

      :param sequence: the sequence that contains the data
      :param continuousdata_label: label of the continuous data to apply the algorithm to

      :returns: A list of Breath objects.
