# Contributing guidelines

We welcome any kind of contribution to our software, from simple comment or question to a full fledged [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

A contribution can be one of the following cases:

1. you have a question;
2. you think you may have found a bug (including unexpected behavior);
3. you want to make some kind of change to the code base (e.g. to fix a bug, to add a new feature, to update documentation);
4. you want to make a new release of the code base.

The sections below outline the steps in each case.

## You have a question

1. use the search functionality [here](git@github.com:EIT-ALIVE/eitprocessing/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;
2. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue;
3. apply the "Question" label; apply other labels when relevant.

## You think you may have found a bug

1. use the search functionality [here](git@github.com:EIT-ALIVE/eitprocessing/issues) to see if someone already filed the same issue;
1. if your issue search did not yield any relevant results, make a new issue, making sure to provide enough information to the rest of the community to understand the cause and context of the problem. Depending on the issue, you may want to include:
   - the [SHA hashcode](https://help.github.com/articles/autolinked-references-and-urls/#commit-shas) of the commit that is causing your problem;
   - some identifying information (name and version number) for dependencies you're using;
   - information about the operating system;
1. apply relevant labels to the newly created issue.

## You want to make some kind of change to the code base

We welcome all contributions to this open-source project, as long as they follow our
[code of conduct](https://github.com/EIT-ALIVE/eitprocessing/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please read out [developers documentation](https://github.com/EIT-ALIVE/eitprocessing/blob/main/README.dev.md) if you are interested in contributing to the code base
