.. py:class:: MovingAverage

   Calculate the moving average of the data.

   The moving average is calculated using a convolution with a window. The
   window length (in seconds) is determined by the attribute
   `averaging_window_duration`. The shape of the window is determined by
   `averaging_window_fun`, which should be a callable that takes an
   integer `M` and returns an array-like sequence containing a window with
   length `M` and area 1.

   Before convolution the data is padded. The padding type is 'edge' by
   default. See `np.pad()` for more information. Padding adds values at the
   start and end with the first/last value, to more accurately determine the
   average at the boundaries of the data.

   :param window_size: the size of the window. Is enlarged by 1 if uneven.
   :param window_fun: window function, e.g. np.window.bartlett.

   :returns: Moving average as a 1D array with the same length as `data`.
