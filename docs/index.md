# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation of the ALIVE software tool designed to load, analyze, and extract parameters from Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) data. 
This software was designed by a joined effort of the Rotterdam Advanced Respiratory Care research group (ROTARC) of the Intensive Care of the Erasmus Medical Center and the Netherlands e-Science center.  [Grant ID: NLESC.OEC.2022.002](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/alive)

EIT is a bedside non-invasive lung imaging tool: it continuously and real-time visualizes changes in lung volume. Our software tool  serves as a comprehensive solution for handling EIT data from multiple leading manufacturers, including Sentec, Dr√§ger, and Timpel.

The software tool includes a back-end for researchers that are familair with programming [eitprocessing](https://github.com/EIT-ALIVE/eitprocessing) and also a user-friendly dashboard [eit_dash](https://github.com/EIT-ALIVE/eit_dash) for clinical researchers allowing to quickly import datasets from various formats and sources and perform processing and analysis. This documentation page concerns eitprocessing. 

Our tool offers robust analysis features. From basic filters to advanced signal processing techniques, you can extract meaningful parameters from your EIT data. With our dashboard we aim to provide default analysis pipelines and many opportunities for customization according to the user needs. Visualizations and interactive graphs make it easy to interpret the results and understand the underlying physiological processes.

It is important to note that the software tool is a work in progress, so not all fuctionalities are available yet. If you would like to contribute to coding you can reach out to us. 

## Getting Started
To start using our software you can you use the [installation](installation.md) guide to set up the software on your system. Once installed, you can load your first dataset and explore the basic features. 
We are committed to supporting your journey with EIT data analysis and extraction. If you encounter any issues or have questions you can put a pull request via github or emailadres.
